This is a simple todo web application made with AngularJS (frontend), and Spring Boot and MySQL (backend).

For test data, I have included an sql file which can be found on frontend/mock-data/todo_mock_data.sql

To run the app:
1. Start mysql connection using xampp or something else
2. Run spring boot
3. Run angularjs
4. View website on http://localhost:8000


TESTING:
1. Spring Boot:
There are only two tests: TodoServiceTest and TodoControllerTest.

2. AngularJS:
type on cmd:
npm run protractor
